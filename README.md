# Fine-Tuned T5 Model and Q-Ease

This repository contains the fine-tuned T5 model and its application, which you can run on Google Colab and Streamlit. The model has been fine-tuned to improve performance on specific tasks, and you can see its live deployment in the video provided below.

## Model

We fine-tuned a T5 model using [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/google/flan-t5-large). You can access the uploaded fine-tuned model here: [FlanT5 Fine-Tuned DEPI](https://huggingface.co/ayaht/flant5finetuneddepi).

### Files in the Repository

1. **Fine-Tuned T5 Model (`fine_tune_t5_depi`)**:
    - This is the uploaded file containing the fine-tuned model that you can use for inference or further training.
    - Hosted on Hugging Face: [FlanT5 Fine-Tuned DEPI](https://huggingface.co/ayaht/flant5finetuneddepi).

2. **Application (`Q_ease`)**:
    - This file contains the Streamlit application that demonstrates the model in action.
    - It is set up to work on Google Colab as well.

### How to Run

You can easily run both the fine-tuned model and the application on Google Colab.

1. **Fine-Tuning T5 Model (`fine_tune_t5_depi`)**:
   - Run all the cells in the notebook to upload and run the fine-tuned T5 model on Colab.

2. **Q-Ease Application**:
   - The application is developed using Streamlit and can be run directly in your Colab environment.
